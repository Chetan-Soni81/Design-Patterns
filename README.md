# 🛠️ Design Patterns Essentials | Interview Prep  

📖 Overview
This project serves as a practical blueprint for the most frequently discussed patterns in system design. Each implementation leverages the latest .NET 9 features to demonstrate Clean Code and SOLID principles.
A refined collection of industry-standard **Design Patterns** implemented using **C# 13** and **.NET 9**.  

🧩 Patterns Covered
Creational: Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, and Singleton.
This repository is structured to help developers master the **technical vocabulary**, **architectural reasoning**, and **structural logic** required for high-level engineering interviews.

Structural: Adapter, Decorator, Facade, and Proxy.
---

Behavioral: Strategy, Observer, State, and Command.
## 📖 Overview  

🚀 Technical Highlights
Target Framework: .NET 9
This project serves as a practical blueprint for the most frequently discussed patterns in system design interviews.  

Modern C# 13: Utilizing primary constructors, collection expressions, and implicit spans for high-performance, readable code.
Each implementation leverages modern **.NET 9** capabilities while adhering to:

Interview-Ready: Each pattern includes a "Real-World Scenario" to help you articulate why a specific pattern is the right choice during a technical deep-dive.
- Clean Code principles  
- SOLID principles  
- Production-ready coding standards  

Unit Tested: Logical flows verified via xUnit to ensure production-ready implementations.
