🛠️ Design Patterns Essentials | Interview Prep
A refined collection of industry-standard Design Patterns implemented in C# 13 and .NET 9. This repository is architected to help developers master the technical vocabulary and structural logic required for high-level engineering interviews.

📖 Overview
This project serves as a practical blueprint for the most frequently discussed patterns in system design. Each implementation leverages the latest .NET 9 features to demonstrate Clean Code and SOLID principles.

🧩 Patterns Covered
Creational: Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, and Singleton.

Structural: Adapter, Decorator, Facade, and Proxy.

Behavioral: Strategy, Observer, State, and Command.

🚀 Technical Highlights
Target Framework: .NET 9

Modern C# 13: Utilizing primary constructors, collection expressions, and implicit spans for high-performance, readable code.

Interview-Ready: Each pattern includes a "Real-World Scenario" to help you articulate why a specific pattern is the right choice during a technical deep-dive.

Unit Tested: Logical flows verified via xUnit to ensure production-ready implementations.
